            <h1>King Arthur</h1>
            <h3>Legend or Historical English King?</h3>
            <p id="intro">Most people have at least heard of King Arthur, and many people may even know a few
                details from the legend, such as the castle Camelot, the Round Table and his famous knights, 
                the sword Excalibur, the wizard Merlin, the Lady of the Lake, Arthur's Queen Guinevere and 
                perhaps even her affair with Arthur's greatest knight, Sir Lancelot.  But many may not realize
                that if there was a King Arthur, none of these details would be true.  In fact, he wouldn't
                have even been called "King".

            <h3 class="subheading">The Historical Arthur</h3>
            <p>If there was a King Arthur, he wouldn't be found in the 13th century England, wearing shining plate armor.
                His followers wouldn't be knights on horseback, jousting with lances.  His castle wouldn't be made
                of stone.  The historical Arthur wouldn't even have been called "king".

                Arthur, if he existed, would have lived in the mid to late 400s CE, in what historians call 
                "sub-Roman Britain".  Britain (England didn't exist yet) was actually a part of the Roman empire for nearly 400 years, 
                long enough for the inhabitants to consider themselves "Roman".  The Romas built roads, walls,
                bath houses, and had a sophisticated administration that ensured peace for the British people.
                But in the early 400's, Rome itself fell under attack by the Goths.  They recalled most of their 
                military to repel this attack, including the Romans in Britain.  This left Britain vulnerable to
                attack.
            </p>
            <h4 class="subheading">Rome Collapses and Britain is Attacked</h4>
            <p>
                First, the attacks came from the Picts in the north.  Britain had no military of its own with the 
                Romans gone, so they called on Anglo-Saxon mercenaries across the channel for help.  The Anglo-Saxons
                drove back the Picts, but couldn't help notice what the Picts also noticed: Britain was ripe for the 
                picking.  The Anglo-Saxons then invaded Britain and began to sweep from east to west, conquering and 
                settling the isle of Britain.  But them something strange happened.  Something stopped them.  Or someone.
            </p>
            <h4 class="subheading">The Saxons are Stopped</h4>
            <p>
                In western Britain, on the border of modern day Wales, the Saxon advance was suddenly stopped, and for
                a couple of generations, there was relative peace among the surviving Britons.  Archaelogical evidence
                shows that a massive fortification at Cadbury Hill was restored at this time, and used by a force of 
                nearly 700.  This was several times larger than the usual British war band at the time, which shows that
                someone of great power, charisma, military strategy and leadership was able to unite and rally a large
                group of people to stand up against and even defeat the Saxons.  If there was an Arthur, it was this man.
            </p>
            <h4 class="subheading">The Documented Evidence</h4>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, we don't know for sure if this man was named "Arthur".  In fact, we don't know much about
                him at all.  Medieval historians do not like the term "Dark Ages", but if there was ever a truly "dark age",
                it was sub-Roman Britain.  Barely anything was recorded and much of the population was likely illiterate,
                so what documentary evidence we have is scant at best, and too often written many years after. The best 
                historical evidence in writing that we have are from three early chronicles.  They are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Ruin of Britain - by Gildas, around 540-560 CE</li>
                <li>The Ecclesiastical History of the British People - by Bede, around 731 CE</li>
                <li>The History of the Britons - by Nennius, around 833 CE</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The earliest of these accounts, Gildas, does not even mention Arthur by name.  He does mention
                the Battle of Mount Badon, and the temporary defeat of the Saxons:
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                    A remnant... take up arms and challenge their victors to battle under Ambrosius Aurelianus.
                    He was a man of unassuming character, who alone of the Roman race who chanced to survive
                    in the shock of such a storm (his parents, people undoubtedly clad in the purple, had been killed),
                    whose offspring in our days have greatly degenerated from their ancestral nobleness.  To these 
                    men, by the Lord's favour, there came victory.</p>
                    <p>
                        From that time, the citizes were sometimes victorious, sometimes the enemy.  This continued
                        up to the year of the siege of Badon Hill, and almost the last great slaughter inflicted upon
                        the rascally crew.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
                Could this "Ambrosius Aurelianus" be the historical Arthur?  Notice how Gildas indicates that this man
                was the last of the Romans left behind in Britain, who survived the Anglo Saxon advance.  He mentions
                that his parents "wore the purple", an indication of nobility among the Romans. Could it be perhaps
                that Arthur was an educated Roman of noble descent, who had the abilities needed to rally the people 
                and repel the Saxons?  Possibly, but we may never know for certain.
